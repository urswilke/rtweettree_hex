# svg hex

The files in this folder are the result of playing around with svg. I used the R
package [minisvg](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/minisvg/). The tree was
created with [flametree](https://github.com/djnavarro/flametree).

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("minisvg.svg")
```

The final svg [minisvg.svg](minisvg.svg) is created with
[create_svg_hex.R](create_svg_hex.R). Unfortunately, the file is not completely
rendered when you view it on github. But when you download it, you can can view
it in firefox.
