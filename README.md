## rtweettree\_hex

This repository was used to create the hex sticker of the package
[rtweettree](https://github.com/urswilke/rtweettree).

<img src="images/hex_sticker.png" width="640" />

It was done with the awesome packages

-   [flametree](https://github.com/djnavarro/flametree),
-   [magick](https://github.com/ropensci/magick),
-   [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/), and
-   [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html).
-   [ggpattern](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/ggpattern).

The birds images in the repo were downloaded as svgs from
<http://www.clker.com/>.

## svg hex

I also played around with svgs and the package
[minisvg](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/minisvg/). You can find the
results in the subfolder [minisvg](minisvg) of this package.
