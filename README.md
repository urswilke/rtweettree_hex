This repository was used to create the hex sticker of the package
[rtweettree](https://github.com/urswilke/rtweettree). It was done with
the awesome packages

-   [flametree](https://github.com/djnavarro/flametree),
-   [magick](https://github.com/ropensci/magick),
-   [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/), and
-   [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html).

The birds images in the repo were downloaded as svgs from
